  <p>I am Nathan Otsuka. I attended the University of Boulder, Colorado, where i majored in International Affairs. I currently work at the Rio Grande Mexican Restaraunt, where I wait tables. As much I love working at the Rio I am progessing towards attaining a position as an Actuary. I have the first three exams passed and have been applying for jobs. While I'm not working I do a little investing on the side and read as much as I can.</p>
